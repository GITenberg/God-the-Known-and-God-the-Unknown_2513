description: Published in 1917, this volume is based on a series of articles published
  by Butler in the 1870s and revised by him prior to his death. Here Butler sets forth
  his conception of the divine, as a evolutionary force that encompasses all living
  things and tends toward ever-greater unity and self-awareness.
